Enjoy this scraper I built to demo scrapy.  First you'll want to make sure you have scrapy.  Install with pip:
```
pip install scrapy
```
or update if you already have it:

```
pip install --upgrade scrapy
```

To get 'er fired up, simply type:

```
git clone https://github.com/erinshellman/backcountry-scraper.git
cd backcountry-scraper
scrapy crawl backcountry -o bc.json
```
